#####################
Update overview 
#####################

* Adds generation of NAM Hawaii nest GEMPAK files.

#####################
Obtaining the package
#####################

Clone it with this command (but change nam.v4.2.1 to whatever you want to call it 
in the directory that it is cloned into):
 
git clone -b v4.2.1 https://github.com/MatthewPyle-NOAA/NAM.git nam.v4.2.1
 
The changes delivered do not require building the code, but if a fresh build is desired, 
these are the basic building steps (courtesy of Eric Rogers in his 4.2.0 delivery):

IMPORTANT NOTE for SPA: Before compiling the NAM codes, remove any module loads you may 
be doing in your .bashrc file login environment. Back in September I had aborts on 
Cactus with the NAM GSI, which Carolyn Pasti and Russ Treadon could not reproduce. 
We determined that they had no module loads in their Cactus .bashrc files, while I did. 
When I removed the module loads from my .bashrc file, my NAM GSI aborts went away. 
The NAM GSI build does run `module purge` before it compiles, but the implication was
that it was not thorough enough. The basic cause of this problem is unsolved and as far 
as I know GDIT has not worked on the ticket I sent in for a while. I do not know if 
this is still a problem but it is best to err on the side of caution. 

./sorc/make_all.sh script compiles all codes in the ./sorc directory

./sorc/make_all_clean.sh cleans all codes and removes all executables from the 
./exec directory.

./util/sorc/make_all.sh compiles all the codes in the ./util/sorc directory

jobs/JNAM_GEMPAK_NEST 

Adds a block for the Hawaii Nest so GEMPAK files get created for this nest as well.

./tm00/gempak/jnam_gempak_nest.ecf

Increases the task count from 5 to 6 to handle the additional domain being processed 
by the job.


#############################
Resource changes:
#############################

Increases the task count for the JNAM_GEMPAK_NEST job from 5 to 6, but should 
not impact timing.
